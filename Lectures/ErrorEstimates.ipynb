    "### Where does the error bar go? \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you measure the average depression of flux in a quasar caused by absorption from the Lyman-alpha forest.  You find that 30\\% of the flux is absorbed, $D_A=0.3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two models that predict $D_A=0.32$ and $D_A=0.4$, respectively. Which do the data favor?  Is either ruled out?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer, we need an error bar, and this may be different for the two models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the first model predicts $D_A=0.32$ on average and an rms variation of $0.002$ from one quasar to another, then the predicted $D_A=0.32 \\pm 0.002$ is strongly inconsistent with the observed $D_A=0.3$, unless the predicted distribution of variations is highly non-Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the second model predicts $D_A=0.4$ on average and an rms variation of 0.05 from one quasar to another, then its prediction $D_A=0.4 \\pm 0.05$ is marginally inconsistent with your measurement.  \n",
    "The data favor this model even though its mean prediction is further from the observed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the Bayesian insistence that error bars really belong _on the model_, not on the data, since different models may predict different error bars for the same data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we measure the decrement for 20 quasars instead of one, and we find a mean of 0.3 and an rms variation about the mean of 0.05.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here it seems legitimate to say that the uncertainty on the mean is $0.05/\\sqrt{20}=0.01$,\n",
    "and that our measurement implies $D_A=0.3 \\pm 0.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What allows us to attach an error bar to the data, and to implicitly claim that it is model independent?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, this procedure relies on the assumption (which should be good in this case) that any model that will fit the data must also predict an rms variation similar to the value $0.05$ that you measured, and that it will therefore predict an error on the mean for a sample of 20 quasars that is close to $0.05/\\sqrt{20}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that predicts a mean $D_A=0.35$ and an rms quasar-to-quasar variation of $0.3$ gives $D_A=0.35 \\pm 0.06$ for a sample of 20 quasars.  But although its mean prediction is consistent with the measured mean within its expected error, the rms variation for this model is inconsistent with the measured rms variation of 0.05, so the model is ruled out, or at least disfavored, on other grounds. (To decide just how inconsistent the model is, we would need to\n",

    "\n",
    "The extreme, and often relevant, example is a survey that turns up one object of a certain class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to say that the measured number of objects is $1 \\pm 1$ and therefore consistent with zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that a model that predicts a mean of one object in a survey of this size predicts (assuming Poisson statistics) that a fraction $e^{-1} = 0.37$ of such surveys would detect no objects, and that a model that predicts a mean of two objects predicts that $2^1 e^{-2}/1! = 0.27$ of such surveys should yield one object and is therefore consistent with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we have a model that predicts a mean of 0.001 objects, then it predicts that only $0.001^1 e^{-0.001}/1! = 0.001$ of such surveys should yield one object, so it is ruled out (or at least strongly disfavored).\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that predicts a mean of 10 objects is also strongly disfavored, as $P(k=1|\\mu=10) = 10^1 e^{-10} = 4.5 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with very small numbers of objects, one can make statistically interesting statements about some models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Low-background example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is relevant to _Chandra_ data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the background is very low, e.g., $10^{-4}$ counts/pixel in a 50 ksec exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have $10^6$ pixels, there will be $\\sim 100$ background counts, so a single-photon detection isn't significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the probability of getting 2 background photons in a pixel is $10^{-8}$, so there should be only $0.01$ pixels out of $10^6$ with two background photons by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, 2 counts in a single pixel would be a statistically significant detection of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you knew ahead of time where you were going to look (e.g., at a recent supernova) to within a pixel, then even a single photon detection would be significant at the $10^{-4}$ level, and would rule out a model that predicted only $10^{-3}$ source counts in a 50 ksec exposure.\n",

    "### Estimating error bars from the data: subsample, jackknife, bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "In a case like the average quasar flux decrement above, it is obvious how to estimate the error bar from the data using the rms variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we are doing something more complicated, e.g., measuring the power spectrum of the flux (a 1-d function) after fitting a  continuum to each spectrum, removing metal lines, and subtracting photon noise.  We have done some complicated processing, and the signal-to-noise of the measurement in each individual spectrum may be quite different from one quasar to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subsample\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to proceed in a complicated case like this is to divide the data into subsamples, say five groups of four quasars each. You can then apply your measurement separately to each subsample and estimate errors from the subsample-to-subsample variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you now have $N=5$ estimates $^kP_i$ of the power spectrum on spatial scale $i$, where $k=1,...N$.  You can estimate the error bar $\\sigma_{ii}$ on $P_i$ as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2_{ii} = {1 \\over N-1} \\sum_{k=1}^N {(^kP_i - \\bar{P_i})^2 \\over N},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\bar{P_i}$ is your estimate from the full sample of all quasars.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also want to estimate the covariance of errors from two different length scales $i$ and $j$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2_{ij} = {1 \\over N-1} \\sum_{k=1}^N \n",
    "  {(^kP_i - \\bar{P_i})(^kP_j-\\bar{P_j}) \\over N}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jackknife\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can run into problems if you really need something closeto your full sample size to get a usable measurement in the first place, so that the estimates from your much smaller subsamples are  wildly varying.  (This is especially problematic if, for instance, you know that the quantity you are measuring is positive-definite\n",
    "but noise means that you can get negative values in individual measurements.)\n",
    "\n",
    "An attractive, more robust alternative is jackknife error estimation, where you {\\it omit} each subsample in turn, and apply your measurement to all of the {\\it remaining} data.  The error estimate in this case is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2_{ii} = {N-1 \\over N} \\sum_{k=1}^N (^kP_i - \\bar{P_i})^2 ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $^kP_i$ now represents the estimate of $P_i$ after subsample $k$ is _omitted_ from the data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-factor is larger by a factor of $(N-1)^2$, but the variation $(^kP_i - \\bar{P_i})$ is smaller because each subset $k$ is now close to the full sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case we are considering, the individual subsamples could now be single quasars, so we could set $N=20$ and omit each quasar in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the jackknife and subsample error estimates would give different answers, I think the jackknife estimate is generally preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used variant on the same theme is bootstrap resampling. Here you create new samples the same size as the original data sample by drawing from that sample \"with replacement.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the $N$ bootstrap samples has $M=20$ quasars randomly drawn from the  original set, but in an individual sample quasar 1 may appear three times, quasar 2 twice, and quasar 3 not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error bars are simply computed from the dispersion among the $M$ bootstrap samples,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2_{ii} = \\sum_{k=1}^N {(^kP_i - \\bar{P_i})^2 \\over N},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\bar{P_i}$ is the estimate from the full sample, not the mean of the bootstrap samples.  There is no pre-factor\n",
    "because now each bootstrap sample is the same size as the full sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping seems to be moderately preferred by the cognoscenti over subsampling or jackknife, but the fact that involves replacement (and a bootstrap sample therefore has some identical elements) can cause problems in some cases, so think about what you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these approaches are implicitly \"transferring\" the error bars as discussed above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind all three is that the data are drawn from some distrbution and that we can estimate that distribution from the data themselves.  Each subsample (or jackknife sample, or bootstrap sample) is drawn from this distribution, so we get an internal estimate of what variation is expected in data drawn from this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we are implicitly assuming that any model that would actually fit the data would have a similar distribution and would therefore predict similar errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical assumption for any of these methods is that the individual subsamples are _independent_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the quasar case described above, this assumption is probably fine, since the regions of the universe sampled by different quasars are far enough apart that they are uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are instead trying to estimate uncertainties in the galaxy correlation function measured from a redshift survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each galaxy is a separate data point, but they are highly correlated because they trace the same underlying structure (e.g., the same clusters and superclusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using subsamples, jackknife, or bootstrap with individual galaxies would severely underestimate the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case, we need to define subsamples that are spatially contiguous  volumes, large enough that the estimates of the correlation function in each subsample are independent.  Roughly speaking, we want to be sure that the spatial size of each subsample is large compared to the largest coherent structures that are found in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of this approach, see Zehavi et al. 2005, ApJ, 630, 1\n"

    "#### Error bars from artificial data sets \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a model that we want to test, and we can generate complete, independent artificial data sets from the model, then it is better to estimate errors and covariances from large numbers of mock data sets instead of using these \"internal\" techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is now common practice to create artificial mock galaxy catalogs from cosmological simulations to estimate errors and covariances for galaxy clustering measurements.\n",

    "In principle one should generate different sets of mock catalogs for all models being tested, or evaluate the dependence of the covariance matrix on model parameters.\n",

    "The accuracy required to estimate errors is usually lower than the accuracy required to evaluate parameters by fitting a model to the data.\n",
