    "### Stiff Equations and Implicit Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to integrate a system where there are two or more very different timescales.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you integrate with timesteps short compared to the shorter timescale, your calculation may never finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example is a hydrodynamic system with cooling. You are typically interested in phenomena happening on the sound-crossing timescale $L/c_s$, where $L$ is the scale of\n",
    "the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a dense region, the cooling timescale may become orders-of-magnitude shorter than the sound-crossing timescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have to do the short timescale integration accurately to get the long timescale behavior to be accurate, then you're stuck. But sometimes the short timescale behavior doesn't matter too much (e.g., it matters that the gas gets cold, but it doesn't matter exactly\n",
    "what its temperature is), and you just need your integration to be stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, an implicit scheme for the short timescale behavior may be useful.  Here is an example from NR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y' = -cy ~, c>0~.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The explicit Euler scheme is\n",

    "If $h > 2/c$, then the method is unstable, with $|y_n| \\rightarrow \\infty$\n",
    "as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y_{n+1} = y_n + h y'_{n+1}.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y_{n+1} = {y_n \\over 1+ch}~,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which gives a stable result even for large $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the implicit equations may be solved by matrix inversion (if they're linear) or by some form of iteration (which we'll get to soon) if they're non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a stiff set of equations, then sometimes the physics of the problem will suggest an alternative solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when timescales for ionization are short compared to other timescales in the system, then relative abundances may always be close to ionization equilibrium, where recombination rates balance ionization rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a set of equations that can be solved as a function of local conditions (e.g., density, temperature), and perhaps stored in a lookup table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in evolution of a hierarchical triple star system where the outer orbital period is much longer than the inner orbital period, it may be adequate to treat the inner binary as a ring with mass spread over the orbit according to the amount of time the stars spend there.\n"
